<h1>HPS Family Association</h1>
<h4>Who We Are and What We Do</h4>
<p>The HPS Family Association’s overall purpose is to enhance the quality of life for the HPS clients and their families. This is achieved by organizing a number of activities that are both educational and/or social in nature; it is recognised that participation from family members also acts as a support for the families.</p>
<p>The Family Association, through the generous donations of family members, is responsible for funding, organizing and implementing two major activities for the clients each year: a family/client Christmas Party and Summer Picnic/BBQ. These two activities continue to be very successful with upwards of 100 people attending each year. This is an opportunity to meet clients, other families and staff in a relaxed and informal social setting.</p>
<p>In addition to these two main activities the Family Association also assists in funding and participating in a number of activities that are sponsored by HPS: Client Social/Recreational Events – such as Spa Day, “Look Well, Feel Well”, a day of workshops/hands on activities. As well, there are sometimes individual requests by a client (via their HPS case worker) for a specific assistance or need (i.e. guitar lessons for 8 weeks). The HPS Family Association also augments funding with regards to the Cottage Studio, a studio which provides, at no charge, the opportunity for mental health consumers/artists to design their creations and display their works of art. This studio is located adjacent to St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church on James St. South. Their working motto is “Promoting mental health through creative art in the Hamilton Community.”</p>


<h4>Oragnization</h4>
<p>Parents, guardians, spouses, and siblings are considered to be members of the HPS Family Association.
A Steering Committee is elected at an Annual General Meeting in the spring and consists of 6 – 10 volunteers from the Association who are each elected for a 2-year term. The Committee meets approximately 7 times per year to plan activities and to authorize requests for funding. These committee meetings are open to family members, participation in the meetings and/or help in organizing activities is welcomed.</p>


<h4>Donations</h4>
<p>Program enrichment with additional funding is only possible through the generosity of family members. Should you wish to make a donation to the Family Association, please make the cheque payable to The HPS Family Association, such should be mailed or dropped off at the Hamilton Program for Schizophrenia. The Family association is a registered charity and tax receipts are issued.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, or would like to take part in any of the committee meetings, please contact HPS and your name will be given to a committee member.</p>
